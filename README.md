> A smart tool to compare structured job role definitions (from XML) with roles found in unstructured PDF job descriptions using AI, RAG, and fuzzy logic.

---

## Overview

The **AI Role Validator** is an intelligent Python application designed to automate and streamline the validation of job roles.

It compares a definitive list of roles specified in a structured **XML file** against roles extracted from unstructured **PDF documents**. Using **Generative AI (Google Gemini)**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **fuzzy string matching**, it ensures consistency, highlights discrepancies, and eliminates hours of manual effort.

## Features

- XML Role Extraction ‚Äì Parses structured XML files for the authoritative list of job roles.
- PDF Content Extraction ‚Äì Reads text and tables from PDFs using `PyMuPDF`.
- LLM-Powered Role Extraction ‚Äì Uses **Google Gemini AI** to extract roles from messy, unstructured text.
- RAG-Based Enhancement ‚Äì Integrates **Pinecone** vector DB for chunk-level retrieval from PDFs.
- Fuzzy Matching ‚Äì Accounts for typos, abbreviations, and formatting inconsistencies.
- Validation Report ‚Äì Clearly classifies:
  - Matched Roles (exact & fuzzy)
  - Unmatched/Incorrect Roles
- Configurable Thresholds ‚Äì Tune fuzzy matching sensitivity.

## How Fuzzy Matching Works

Used to catch **typos** and **minor word-level errors**.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Levenshtein Distance ‚Äì `fuzz.ratio()`

> **Example:**
> XML: `Tester`
> PDF: `Tester`
> ‚Üí Edit distance = 1 substitution
> ‚Üí Similarity ‚âà **83.33%**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Ratcliff-Obershelp ‚Äì `fuzz.partial_ratio()`

Used to catch **abbreviations** or **substring matches**.

> **Example:**
> XML: `Software Engineer`
> PDF: `Software Eng.`
> ‚Üí Partial ratio = **100%**
> (as it's a near-perfect subset)

The intelligent combination of both methods ensures robust matching, even across formatting variations and abbreviations.
